A description of our understanding of the paths for implementing and launching the technology we have developed, as of the site's launch date.

## Paths to Creating the System
### Investors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elated by the solution we had obtained, we were ready to take on the entire project's implementation and promotion. All that was needed was to find the money. Thus, the task arose to find investors: to convince people to invest their funds in our project, to believe in us. And crucially, money is invested in something that has legally protected value, not just in our words and charm.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This compelled us to bring our solution to a legally protectable form. That is, to patent it. The work on the patents convinced us that there are no technologies similar to ours—that solve all problems simultaneously. At the same time, the need arose to demonstrate the economic feasibility of investing in our inventions. This forced us to spend time on the economic justification and to take a deeper look at the challenges of the technical implementation of our system. This led us to the idea that the optimal path would be to partner with those for whom the technical embodiment of our system would be organic and would guaranteed lead to a high-quality result.

### Partners
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We envisioned a solid company as a partner, one that has achieved notable results in data protection, network security, network reliability, application development, or messenger promotion. We assume that the company should have a reputation as a reliable partner and sufficient profit so that investments in our project are not burdensome for it, and so it does not fear a long path to profitability. Its range of interests should include socially significant projects, and its background should feature support for civic initiatives.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it became obvious that a presentation of our project, demonstrating its depth and thoroughness, cannot be complete without presenting the broad panorama. And a manager whose level is sufficient to make a decision about cooperation is unlikely to be able to devote enough time and attention to studying it. This made it necessary to create a website that paints this panorama. But such a website will organically include reflection of current changes and discussion of pressing issues related to online secret voting, its possibilities, and its role in society.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the site's launch (December 2025), the search for a partner has only just begun.

## Promotion Prospects
### System Certification
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the use of our system in legally significant votes is only possible based on a decision by legislators. For legislators to adopt such a decision, they must have convincing proof of the implemented system's complete conformity with its stated qualities, including absolute reliability. Such proof can only be the results of successful (flawless) controlled testing conducted under conditions of rigorous adversarial pressure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conducting such testing and publishing its results is the primary task that must be solved for the widespread adoption of our system. At the same time, the system is designed to conduct this testing under conditions indistinguishable from those of its subsequent use, yet without requiring legislative decisions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in our system, the data used for voter authentication, in accordance with laws existing in various countries and specific territories, does not qualify as personal data. The information used in our system for voter authentication can be sourced from any available channels and freely published for its verification.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test trials should take place during specially organized referendums that have no legal consequences and are conducted under the observation, control, and specialized adversarial testing by experts (e.g., specialists from accredited laboratories like Voting System Test Laboratories). The outcome of testing our system must be the absence of negative assessments regarding its functioning and a unanimous endorsement of its use by all expert bodies, especially by those who attempted unsuccessfully to breach or discredit it. The existence of positive evaluations should serve as the primary argument for adopting our system, reducing the task of its promotion to disseminating information about its proven merits.

### Incorporation Incentives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the expert-confirmed advantages of our system, which eliminates virtually all known threats, a substantial argument for its incorporation into the legal framework of any state should be the radical reduction in costs associated with conducting secret ballots, referendums, and polls studying public opinion on socially significant issues, accompanied by the extreme simplicity of their execution. A separate incentive should be the inevitable increase in voter turnout and citizen engagement due to the ease and accessibility of voting.
