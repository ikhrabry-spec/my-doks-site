An enumeration of the most critical changes in the mechanisms of societal democratization that are set in motion by the implementation of a system based on our technology. A description of the role such a system plays in fostering political stability, reducing social tension and conflict within society, and preventing destructive processes and critical crises.

## The Formation of a Collective Intelligence
### A Toolkit for Collective Thinking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system provides the capability to anonymously publish theses and to evaluate them with the same level of anonymity. This allows society to familiarize itself with the arguments on the most pressing issues and to see the real level of support for various ideas.

### The Formation of Public Understanding and Societal Self-Organization
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through anonymous debates and the verifiable weighing of ideas, positions, or aspirations, our system transforms disparate opinions into a structured, objective picture of public preferences. It allows individuals to join the majority or to persuade that majority through a public, open process. Its presence enables a transition from contemplating a chaos of diverse opinions to the conceptual self-awareness of society, which can serve as the foundation for the public will.

### An Environment for Direct Communication Between the Authorities and Society
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direct exchange of opinions, public debates, the possibility of providing detailed explanations for one's positions, and the anonymity that allows for fearless criticism of the authorities transform our system into a space for substantive dialogue between the government and the society.

## Political Roles
### In a Stable Democracy: A Platform for Mutual Adjustment of Public Opinion and Government Actions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system can provide a permanent connection between voters and their elected officials. It allows empowered representatives to reflect the genuine will of their constituents and to represent their interests. It constitutes a practical mechanism that enables the government to be accountable to society, to explain its actions in real time, and to change them in accordance with public sentiment. It allows the government to understand which of its necessary actions are unpopular and to work towards changing public attitude towards them, to achieve public understanding and support.

### In a Crisis: An Arbitration Mechanism
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system serves as a tool to instantly make any government action visible and measurable, thereby granting or stripping it of legitimacy.

### The Infrastructure for Realizing Society's Agency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system is an infrastructure for creating parallel legitimacy. It enables civil society to self-organize, to conduct verifiable elections and polls, thereby depriving usurpers of the monopoly on representing the will of the people. Society acquires agency and becomes a real force in the struggle against usurpation, stripping the usurper of legitimacy and thus depriving the security structures of the moral grounds to serve them.
