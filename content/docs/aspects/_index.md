Costs of organizing and conducting the voting process during the elections of heads and parliamentarians of states, regions, cities, and localities. Problems and legal violations during this process, such as ballot stuffing and counting fraud. Violations of law during the election campaign. Abuse of power throughout the entire election period.

## [Costs](/docs/aspects/Costs/)  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of costs for conducting secret voting at the state level. The level of costs established in the 2020s. The market size for the computerization of secret voting and the consumers of election services. Prospects for changing these costs through computerization.


## [Problems](/docs/aspects/Problems/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional secret voting creates problems at every stage: in the pre-election phase, during the voting process, and when determining the results and their reliable publication. These problems can be caused by malicious actors involved in the election. They can be members of the Central Election Commission, members of the territorial election commissions, members of the precinct election commissions, voters, and non-voters.

## [Attempts](/docs/aspects/Attempts/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All methods of improving the traditional secret voting process through computerization have turned out to be sources of a number of new problems inherent to these methods.

## [Requirements](/docs/aspects/Requirements/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of reasons, as of the creation of this site (December 2025), that still prevent the widespread use of online voting in electoral processes, and the qualities that an online secret voting system must possess as a result.
