          <p><strong>Abstract (quote):</strong> A system and method of mutual authentication of group members through video is presented. The presented invention proposes a method for authenticating a group of people using computer devices equipped with video recording devices inter-connected into a peer-to-peer overlay network. The verification is based on the analysis of actions and reactions of a user that are inseparable from their appearance and represent either their response to unpredictable video situations or their actions according to unpredictable instructions. The invention is efficient, in particular, for online voter authentication, where it counters malicious actors that might have access to personal authentication data of voters. It prevents these actors from using this authentication data (e.g., certificates, tokens, biomarkers, photos and videos of voters) to create bots voting instead of real people. In addition, it prevents fake user authentication through devices and passwords that were seized or stolen from voters.<p>

          <p><em><strong>System and method of secret online voting countering vote stuffing and substitution, vote trading and pressure on voters</strong>

          - <strong>inventors:</strong> Khrabryi, Aleksandr
          - <strong>published date:</strong> 2024-10-14
          - <strong>jurisdiction:</strong> United States</em></p>

          <p><strong>Abstract (quote):</strong> The proposed system and method eliminate the possibility of vote loss, stuffing and substitution during secret online voting. Voters can verify the accuracy of their votes in the final results only during the public procedure. They also have the option to change their choice within the allotted voting period, eliminating the motivation behind vote trading and coercion. Results are available to all participants immediately after the voting concludes. Additionally, a view of the social distribution of preferences can be obtained. At the core of the system are personal devices connected into a peer-to-peer network. The invention relies on direct messaging between devices within the network, employing asymmetric multi-stage encryption, distributed storage of information with redundancy, and independent processing by each device. Together, these elements minimize the computational resources and financial costs for voting organizers.<p>

          <p><strong>Brief:</strong> The patent proposes a method in which several processors receive voter identification information associated with a voter’s account and verify the voter’s right to vote according to the organizer’s requirements. Part of the identification information is encrypted, and the encrypted and remaining parts are stored separately on a blockchain. After a voting request is submitted from the voter’s account, multiple processors access the account, verify voting eligibility and whether the voter has already voted, receive the voter’s vote together with the account signature, and store portions of the voting data in encrypted and unencrypted form on the blockchain. Identification data may include biometric data and signature, the received vote, global positioning data, and voting time. <p>

          <p><strong>Brief:</strong> The patent states a method for electronic voting or polling using a distributed ledger. A node receives a transaction commit request containing encrypted votes and cryptographic authentication or input verification proofs. A smart contract authenticates the user ID and verifies encrypted votes using a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol. If verification succeeds, the transaction data block is added to the distributed ledger. <p>

          <p><strong>Brief:</strong> The patent proposes an electronic voting system using mathematical anonymization criteria. One voting server receives voting data containing a voter-related identifier and vote information. The system evaluates whether the data meets predefined anonymization criteria and generates two blocks: one containing anonymized voting data and another containing non-compliant data linked to the voter. These blocks are attached to a blockchain. Compliance with anonymization criteria is determined by consensus among servers, and voting results are displayed accordingly. <p>

          <p><strong>Brief:</strong> One of the earliest attempts to reduce the ability of vote organizers to influence voting results. The patent proposes the use of a local network in which the voting process is initiated by a majority of participants. Each participant sends their vote to all other participants, where the votes are accumulated in a shared results buffer. Approval of voting results occurs when most participants find their own vote recorded in the buffer. The method does not provide for encryption and relies on mutual visibility and majority confirmation within the distributed environment. <p>

          <p><strong>Brief:</strong> The patent describes a system for secure and anonymous electronic polling in which a voter’s vote is homomorphically encrypted and transmitted together with the voter’s digital signature and a voting access token from the voter’s device. Multiple receiving devices verify the signature and token, using a hash value based at least in part on the unique hardware identifier of the receiving device and its type. After verification, the encrypted vote is stored in a data warehouse and also recorded in a publicly available distributed registry. The system does not provide for decryption of votes or their public disclosure. <p>

          - <strong>priority date:</strong> January 30, 2017,
          - <strong>jurisdiction:</strong> European Patent (EP)</em></p>

          <p><strong>Brief:</strong> The patent proposes a voting system and method in which each voter is identified by a single public identification key. The system includes nodes responsible for collecting and combining votes into a container and storing this container in a public data repository. Nodes exchange public voting keys and apply cryptographic techniques to remove the association between public voting keys and public identification keys, forming a list of anonymized public voting keys. After this unlinking, votes authenticated by anonymized public voting keys are transmitted and combined into a voting container.

          A later version of the invention, published on August 2, 2023, as EP3574482B8, introduces an electronic signature that re-establishes an association between voting public keys and identity public keys. The early version does not prevent vote stuffing, while the later version addresses vote stuffing but still does not eliminate vote trading or voting under coercion. <p>

          - <strong>priority date:</strong> December 23, 2020,
          - <strong>jurisdiction:</strong> United States</em></p>

          <p><strong>Brief:</strong> The patent discloses electronic voting systems that encode voter selections in a compressed format suitable for both electronic processing and paper-based verification. The voting device presents the voter with multiple alternatives for one or more votes and allows the voter to select one or more options. Based on the selections, the device creates a bitmap consisting of bit cells corresponding to voting alternatives, where each cell stores a binary value indicating whether the alternative was selected.

          The bitmap is converted into a compressed character string, which is then encoded into one or more barcodes. These barcodes are printed onto paper to form a paper ballot.

          The system further includes a summarizing device capable of reading the printed barcodes, decoding the compressed character string, converting it back into binary form, determining the selected voting options, and storing these options in the official vote records. The approach combines compact encoding, machine readability, and paper auditability of voting results. <p>

          - <strong>jurisdiction:</strong> United States</em></p>

          <p><strong>Brief:</strong> The patent application proposes a method for conducting elections that allows voters to verify that their ballot was included in the final tally in the same order in which it was submitted and to cryptographically prove whether their ballot was altered or removed.

          The method includes converting a voter-completed ballot into a predefined digital format and cryptographically signing it using a cryptographic processor that stores the voter’s private key from an asymmetric key pair. The formatted ballot, its signature, the corresponding public key, and an identifying characteristic of the cryptographic processor are transmitted to the election server.

          The election authority then signs the formatted ballot using its own private key from an asymmetric key pair. The authority’s signature on the ballot is transmitted back to the voter, enabling the voter to retain cryptographic proof of inclusion and integrity. The system emphasizes public auditability, voter verifiability, and cryptographic assurance of ballot handling without relying on trust in election administrators alone. <p>

          <p><em><strong> Method of verifiable and anonymous voter receipt for electronic voting system </strong>

          - <strong>inventors:</strong> Zhenxiang Zhang,
          - <strong>priority date:</strong> December 04, 2017,
          - <strong>jurisdiction:</strong> United States</em></p>

          <p><strong>Brief:</strong> The patent describes a voting method that provides voters with an anonymous, verifiable, secure, and forgery-resistant receipt while preserving ballot secrecy and transparency. The receipt encodes the voter’s choice indirectly by placing a unique voter number—randomly generated by the electronic voting system—into a specific line of the ballot corresponding to the selected option.

          In addition to the voter’s unique number and signature (randomly generated symbols associated with the voter), the receipt also contains entries for all other ballot options, filled with unique numbers and signatures of other voters. This design prevents third parties from determining how a specific voter voted while still allowing individual verification.

          The voter’s receipt can be printed on paper, stored on a digital medium, sent via mobile communication, or delivered by email. Voters can later verify their receipt against published election results. The method is applicable to electronic voting systems operating within polling station networks, mobile networks, or the Internet. <p>
