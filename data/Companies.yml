        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> BigPulse Voting provides a web-based voting platform that does not require client-side software installation and relies on Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication mechanisms, including CAS, Shibboleth, SOAP, LDAP, Flexmls, and third-party identity providers such as Facebook. Voting data is stored on BigPulse’s own server infrastructure, with daily security checks, structured backup and disaster recovery procedures, and end-to-end 256-bit TLS/SSL encryption. The company states that data storage and processing comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and that it is certified under the EU–US Data Privacy Framework.

        The system enforces a one-vote-per-voter rule and issues digital voting receipts, which can be digitally signed. Multiple anonymity configurations are supported, including modes that provide full ballot secrecy and others that allow voter identification; in non-anonymous modes, re-voting is permitted. Election results are published via secure URLs. Voters are notified by email and receive unique links granting direct access to ballots. The platform supports voter segmentation, accessibility features for visually impaired voters, multilingual interfaces, and a wide range of voting methods.

        * **Target audience:** Organizations, associations, institutions, and enterprises conducting remote or hybrid elections.
        * **Voting technology and architecture:** Browser-based online voting platform with SSO authentication, encrypted data storage, configurable anonymity, and digital receipts.
        * **Scope and limitation:** Designed for organizational and institutional elections; not positioned as a system for national public political elections.

        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Simply Voting provides an online election service allowing administrators to configure election schedules, ballot structures, and voter lists. The system automatically generates unique passwords for each voter, which can be distributed via mass email using the built-in Email Blast feature, along with direct voting links. As an alternative, customers may integrate their own authentication mechanisms.

        Voters access elections through the customer’s proprietary website, where they are authenticated and presented with available ballots. Voters who have not yet participated receive a tamper-proof electronic ballot. Completed ballots are encrypted and stored anonymously. Upon voting, each voter receives a receipt and is prevented from voting again in the same election. During the voting period, administrators can monitor turnout and send reminder messages. After voting closes, results and detailed reports are immediately available and may be published. Published results can be independently checked by downloading files containing ballots and receipt codes. Simply Voting states that it guarantees the reliability of its hardware, software, and personnel.

        * **Target audience:** Associations, corporations, cooperatives, and organizations conducting online elections.
        * **Voting technology and architecture:** Web-based voting system with encrypted ballots, voter authentication, receipt issuance, and centralized tallying.
        * **Scope and limitation:** Intended for organizational and corporate elections; relies on centralized infrastructure and administrative trust.

        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Assembly Voting offers the Electa online voting system, which uses a distributed cryptographic model. Prior to an election, election officials each generate a personal component of a shared decryption key, which can only be activated collectively. Voters receive two separate access codes via independent channels to access their digital ballots. Ballots are encrypted before transmission, and voters receive digital receipts.

        Encrypted votes are mixed to ensure anonymity. All election-related actions are logged. After the election closes, a required number of election officials jointly verify that no votes were added, altered, or removed. Only after verification are the anonymous votes decrypted to produce the final result. Verification is based on mathematical methods documented in the system’s cryptographic protocol documentation. The company declares cooperation with government structures, though not in the direct conduct of voting.
        * **Target audience:** Organizations and institutions requiring cryptographically verifiable online elections.
        * **Voting technology and architecture:** Online voting system using encryption, distributed decryption keys, vote mixing, and formal cryptographic verification.
        * **Scope and limitation:** Complex operational model requiring coordinated election officials; designed for structured elections rather than informal polling.

The New South Wales government selected Scytl to provide software for its iVote online voting system between 2018 and 2022. In Malta, Scytl and Idox implemented the eCount electronic vote-counting system beginning in 2019. In Norway, an internet voting project using Scytl technology was discontinued in 2014 due to security concerns, lack of turnout improvement, and high costs.

        Scytl entered a joint venture with Swiss Post to deploy the sVote system in several Swiss cantons for expatriate voting; however, Swiss authorities banned its use in referendums in May 2019, and the system has not been used since. Swiss Post acquired the software rights in 2020 following Scytl’s financial difficulties. Scytl UAE provides digital voting systems for Federal National Council elections in the United Arab Emirates. The company holds multiple patents related to data protection, encryption, and secure storage.
