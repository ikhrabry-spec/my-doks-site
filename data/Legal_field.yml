It specifies the categories of persons subject to liability (including election commission members, candidates, and authorized representatives) and establishes a range of penalties, from substantial fines to forced labor and imprisonment.

          <p><em>Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. Article 141: Obstruction of the exercise of electoral rights or the work of election commissions. Federal Law No. 63-FZ of June 13, 1996 (as amended). Official text available via ConsultantPlus, current version accessed 2025.</em></p>

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> This article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation establishes criminal liability for acts that obstruct the free exercise of citizens’ electoral rights, participation in referendums or nationwide votes, violate the secrecy of voting, or interfere with the lawful activities of election commissions and their members. The provision covers both individual acts of obstruction and aggravated forms involving abuse of official position, coercion, deception, bribery, violence, or organized group activity.

          A distinct and significant element of Article 141 is its explicit inclusion of unlawful interference in the operation of the State Automated System of the Russian Federation “Vybory,” recognizing technological infrastructure as a protected component of the electoral process. The article thus frames electoral integrity not only as a matter of voter freedom and commission independence, but also as a matter of safeguarding institutional and technical mechanisms underlying vote administration.

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> In this ruling, the German Federal Constitutional Court held that the use of electronic voting systems is unconstitutional if the correctness of the election result cannot be verified by the general public without specialist technical knowledge. The Court emphasized that all essential steps of an election must be subject to public scrutiny. As a consequence, the decision effectively prohibited the use of many classes of DRE and remote electronic voting systems that lack a voter-verifiable paper trail or equivalent cryptographically provable verification mechanisms.

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> Estonian law establishes the legal basis for remote electronic voting (i-voting) in parliamentary elections. The system relies on mandatory state-issued electronic identification (ID-card, Mobile-ID, Smart-ID) and includes procedural safeguards such as voter authentication, cryptographic protection, and auditability. A distinctive feature is the possibility for voters to cancel an electronically cast vote by voting again at a polling station, with the in-person vote prevailing. This mechanism is intended to mitigate coercion and vote-buying risks. </p>

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> The Canada Elections Act requires explicit parliamentary authorization before alternative voting methods, including electronic voting, may be deployed in federal elections. While the Act allows testing and experimentation subject to oversight by Parliament or its committees, nationwide remote electronic voting has not been adopted. In practice, experimentation has been confined to municipal and territorial elections, reflecting a centralized, risk-averse federal regulatory approach.

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> The law establishes comprehensive requirements for cybersecurity governance within mainland China. It mandates that network operators ensure the security and integrity of personal and network data, including requirements for monitoring, log retention, compliance with standards, and protection against unauthorized access. Operators of critical information infrastructure must store personal and important data domestically unless a security assessment authorizes overseas transfer, and must adopt technical and managerial measures to prevent leaks, destruction, and loss of data. These provisions, together with server localization and other operational security duties, significantly constrain the operation of remote and distributed electronic services, including potential remote e-voting platforms that rely on foreign infrastructure or decentralized architectures.
