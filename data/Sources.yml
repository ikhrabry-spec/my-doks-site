          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> This analytical review provides a systematic overview of international practices in using video surveillance technologies during elections. The primary focus is on the member states of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), with additional examples from the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region. The article examines the diverse legal frameworks, technical implementations (e.g., webcam placement, internet streaming, local recording), and stated objectives (transparency, fraud prevention, voter trust) behind the adoption of such systems in countries including Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Latvia, the United States, Ukraine, Brazil, and India. A key finding is the significant variation in approaches, ranging from mandatory nationwide deployment to selective use and even legislative prohibition (as in Mexico). The author highlights critical issues such as the need for clear regulations, the importance of safeguarding ballot secrecy, and the unresolved question of the legal evidential value of video recordings in electoral disputes.</p>

On three of these screenshots, a red annotation highlights the total percentage of votes allocated to the participating parties on those specific screens — each total inexplicably exceeds 100%. A fourth screenshot has a red underline drawing attention to the ruling party receiving nearly 100% of the votes.</p>

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> This fact-checking article investigates the origin of the infamous "146% of votes" figure that appeared on screen during the live broadcast of the 2011 Russian State Duma election results. The piece examines competing explanations for the anomaly: a technical glitch in the GAS "Vybory" automated system, an error by television editors manually inputting data, and allegations of intentional fabrication. It cites statements from former CEC head Vladimir Churov, a regional election official, a systems expert, and a broadcast cameraman. The conclusion is that the televised numbers did not reflect the final official protocol and that this incident, while a significant cultural meme, is not in itself a serious argument for discussing systemic electoral fraud, unlike analyses by electoral statisticians.</p>

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> This detailed scientific article applies statistical methods to analyze the official results of the 2011 Russian State Duma elections. Building on the author's earlier research, it identifies persistent anomalies: a strong positive correlation between turnout and votes for the ruling United Russia party (unlike other parties), and abnormal, non-bell-shaped distribution of turnout across precincts. A key finding is the comparison between precincts with automated ballot scanners (KOIB) and those without, showing that the described anomalies disappear where automated counting was used. The author proposes a method to separate "normal" and "anomalous" votes for United Russia, estimating the latter at 15.2 million nationally. The analysis concludes that after removing the estimated anomalous votes, United Russia's result would have fallen to approximately 34%, compared to its official tally of about 50%.</p>

          <p><em>[Сергей Шпилькин. 'Двугорбая Россия'. Троицкий вариант — Наука, № 214, 20 декабря 2016, стр. 1-3.]</em></p>

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> In this article, independent election researcher Sergey Shpilkin analyzes the official data from the 2016 State Duma elections. Applying his signature methodology, the discovers that the distribution of votes depending on turnout has formed a distinct "double-humped" curve. The first peak, reflecting "normal" voting, is at an unprecedentedly low turnout of ~37%. The second peak at high turnouts (80-95%) is formed almost exclusively by votes for United Russia. Shpilkin argues that these votes in the second peak are "phantom" (falsified) and estimates their number at 12.1 million, or about 45% of all votes officially received by the party. The article provides a table of "corrected" election results, lists regions that made the largest contribution to the anomalies, and concludes that despite the change in the leadership of the Central Election Commission, the scale of falsifications remained comparable to the 2011 elections.</p>

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> This collection of visual testimonies brings together key images that became symbolic of the organization of the vote in the summer of 2020. It includes a report from the Ukrainian publication Apostrophe, a popular post on the Russian-language blog Dzen, and Google search results for 'Голосование на пеньках (Voting on stumps)' that aggregate many similar photographs. Together, these sources form a cohesive body of evidence for the widespread practice of organizing voting in temporary, often informal locations (on tree stumps, in car trunks, on football fields), which has been a subject of public and expert discussion. Visual testimonies serve as a primary source for the analysis of this historical and social phenomenon.</p>

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> This source examines how election administration costs are structured in practice, focusing on the operational and organizational components of in-person secret voting. It discusses categories of expenditure such as facilities, equipment, staffing, logistics, training, and ballot handling, with particular attention to how these costs arise at the level of election administration rather than political campaigning.

Election Administration Costs in Local Jurisdictions: Results from a Nationwide Data Collection Project. Presented at the Election Sciences, Reform, and Administration (ESRA) Conference, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2018.</em></p>

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> This study reports the results of a nationwide empirical project measuring the costs of election administration at the local level in the United States. It situates election expenditures within the institutional context of decentralized election governance and focuses on per-voter administrative costs across states and jurisdictions. The analysis demonstrates substantial variation in costs, documents methodological difficulties in aggregating election expenditures, and provides baseline estimates for average per-voter costs and total nationwide spending on local election administration in a typical election year.</p>

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> This summary report contextualizes and synthesizes empirical findings on election administration costs in the United States. It explains why election costs are difficult to measure accurately, emphasizing the fragmented and decentralized nature of election governance and the absence of standardized accounting practices. The document clarifies the scope, limitations, and interpretive boundaries of cost estimates and situates per-voter figures within broader methodological constraints.</p>

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> This aggregated source situates government spending on elections in Indonesia within both a fiscal and institutional context. The Jakarta Globe article provides a concrete, time-specific estimate of state budget expenditures allocated to the organization and conduct of the 2024 electoral cycle, including national parliamentary and presidential elections, as well as preparations for subsequent regional and local elections.

          <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> This source provides a comparative overview of countries that have implemented electronic voting technologies, distinguishing between systems based on Direct-Recording Electronic (DRE) machines with and without a Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT). It enumerates jurisdictions using DRE systems, including countries employing VVPAT mechanisms (such as India, Mexico, and the Russian Federation) and those operating without voter-verifiable paper records (such as Brazil and France). The material is descriptive rather than prescriptive and situates national practices within a broader global landscape of electronic voting adoption.</p>
